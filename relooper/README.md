Relooper
========

Relooper turns unstructured branches and jumps into [structured blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming).

Inspired by the [Cheerp Stackifier algorithm](https://medium.com/leaningtech/solving-the-structured-control-flow-problem-once-and-for-all-5123117b1ee2) and the [Relooper algorithm paper by Alon Zakai](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/master/docs/paper.pdf).

More details on the precise algorithm this package implements to come.
